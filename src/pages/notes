1. Make another break point to account for screen sizes between 414px and 1085px.
   //2. Make it so that the no more articles to view button doesn't change back to view more when it is clicked.
   //3. On the invidiual blog post page, make it so that when your click on a recent article, it takes the user to the top of the article page. Make this change happen for the recent articles previews too.
